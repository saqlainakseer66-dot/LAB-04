  Linked List Menu Program in Java

ðŸ”¹ Overview

This project is a menu-driven program in Java that demonstrates the complete implementation of Linked Lists with all important operations.
It supports:

Singly Linked List
Doubly Linked List
Circular Linked List

The program provides a console menu to choose the linked list type and then perform various operations like *insertion, deletion, traversal, searching, etc.
It is designed to help students and developers *learn Linked List concepts in Data Structures step by step â€” from scratch to advanced.

ðŸ”¹ Features

 1. Singly Linked List

 Traversal (Iterative & Recursive)
 Insert at Beginning
* Insert at End
* Insert at Position (Middle)
* Insert After a Node
* Delete from Beginning
* Delete from End
* Delete at Position
* Delete by Value
* Search Element

---

### 2. *Doubly Linked List*

* Traversal (Forward & Backward)
* Insert at Beginning
* Insert at End
* Insert at Position
* Delete from Beginning
* Delete from End
* Delete at Position
* Search Element

---

### 3. *Circular Linked List*

* Traversal (Iterative & Recursive)
* Insert at Beginning
* Insert at End
* Insert at Position
* Delete from Beginning
* Delete from End
* Delete at Position
* Search Element
